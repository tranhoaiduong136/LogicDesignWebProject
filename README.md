# LogicDesignWebProject 
## I.*Introduction*:
Nowadays,MIPS has become an powerful language that support the student to interact with Computer Architecture.<br />
Therefore,we have made an website in order to help students understanding deeper about this subject. <br />
## II.*Contributors* :
Web design: Nguyen Le Thao Vy <br />
C++ developers: [Le Nguyen Tan Loc](https://github.com/leloc0609) <br />
C++ and Database developers: [Tran Hoai Duong](https://github.com/tranhoaiduong136) <br />

## III.*Preview the project* : <br/>
There are 2 ways to see our project:<br />
### Preview online without technical installation
We have hosted it online by using the hosting page [000webhost](https://vn.000webhost.com/).<br/>
<img src= "Pictures/Webpage.png" height = "300"> <br/>
### Preview offline: <br/>
> Making sure that your computer have PHP, JS and C++ environment. <br />
>
First, you need to download the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) which can create the virtual host. <br />
After that, you can watch this video : [HOW TO USE XAMPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H29Z8ZLw6I) to execute our project. <br />
> After this part, if you want to check our database, you can go to the phpMyAdmin to check it <br/>
> If you don't know where it is, just check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvXLUJAQwu4)
> 
## IV.*What technologies this website use*:
### Frontend:
In this part,we have used HTML,CSS and Javascript to code the frontend.<br />
### Backend:
We have used C++ to code the backend file and PHP to make iteraction between frontend and database. <br />
### Virtual host: 
 XAMPP can be helpful <br />

##  V.*Functions*:
There are 3 main functions you can make use of :<br />
First, user can track down and see the list of books which we have prepared for studing and external research.<br />

> Users can add more books or documents by cliking this button

Secondly, user can choose the [**MIPS Single-cycle Datapath Visualizer**](https://mips4everyone.000webhostapp.com/datapath-visualizer) which can help the users visualize better how it actually works <br />
> There are some notes beside the visualization <br />
> 
Thirdly, user can choose the [**MIPS Simulator**](https://mips4everyone.000webhostapp.com/simulator) which have 3 modes:<br />
| Numbers | Functions|
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Virtual machine (C++ implementation)|
| 2 | Machine Code to Assembly code |
| 3 | Assembly code to Machine code |

>Because we have made the mistakes in coding C++ without considering the frameworks as well as the environment online , therefore, these 3 modes right now can only run remotely in your computer side. We have made video instructions about this problem.

>There are also videos we have made so that can help you easier going through our website. <br /> 

>Because we don't have much experience in using PHP to communicate with backend storage so that we have put those HTML into PHP files which can cause difficult for future updates. <br />
